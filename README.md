If the ```Create rules on new links``` option is on, you will be able to choose from a list of your web browsers when you open an unrecognized website. The web browser you choose will be the default for that website from now on.<br>

![Dialog Guide](doc/BowserDialogGuide.png?raw=true "Bowser Dialog Guide")

When creating or editing rules, you can choose which part/s of a web address to check them against. You can also make this selection on the new link dialog. The default is just the website name.<br>
